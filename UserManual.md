## Smoothie Cart Manager - User Manual

This user manual will describe how to use the Smoothie Cart Manager android application. There are 5 major operations that can be performed: adding a customer, editing an existing customer’s information, processing a purchase, retrieving a customer’s purchase history, and retrieving a customer’s reward status.       
** IMPORTANT: For the purposes of this assignment, you must manually input the ID number for the desired customer whenever needed, which can be obtained through logCat or by writing it down when it appears on the screen.** 

### Adding a customer
1. Select the "Add Customer" button from the main menu.
2. Enter the Name, Billing Address, and E-mail for the customer in the appropriate fields.
3. Once all fields are completed, press the "Add Customer" button to add the customer into the database, with a unique 32 digit hexadecimal ID that will be created automatically.  The app will reject any empty fields and ask you to try again if that is the case.
